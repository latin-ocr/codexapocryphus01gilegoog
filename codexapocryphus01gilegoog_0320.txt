NOTES. lxxiii

Any proper mame ol God aud the appellative word Dio itself, are
constanti, writ in red letters out οἱ respect, :ud ιο are the Ambio
notes iu transverse lines ou the margin. The content.» οἱ the
chnpters ure likewisn written iu red lenter-s, and resch about the
tveutieth ; ιι void spuoe being lest for the rest before each chapter,
but uo where fiu’d up. Tho author ui these summaries vens ι
zeulouz musulmnu, who charges the Christiana nll along with falsi-
fienfion, from thiu his only anthemio gospel. But they'll be no-
thing behind haud winh him, wheuever his gospel eomes ιο be ὁ
better known. Much care and ornament was heebow’d upon the
whob, and the Arabio word Allah is iu red letters supemlitiously
interlin’d over Dio, for the first three times it occurs. The story
οἱ Jeeus is very differently bo1d iu many things stom the received
gospels, but much more fully und partioulurly ς this gospcl, if my
eye lus not deeeiv’d me, being near aa long again as any of uuus.
Some would make this circumstauoe a prejudioe iu favour of ie,
because, u all things ure best known just after they huppen, so
every thing diminishoe, the further it procedes from its original.
But iu this ease the rule will be found not rightly applied, nn the
book is prov'd w be the genuine issue οἱ Barnabas. Mahomet is
thereiu expreszly mm’d ior the paraclete, u we have been told
:hat he is uo esteemed, by all the historiam οἱ the Mnhometuu
religion: the Musulmaus amusing our gospds n! corruption, and
pretending further that Mnhomet’s name was struck out ο( the
Peutateuch md the Psalm. Muhomet is mm'd again or {oretum
in some other places of thu book oi Barnabas, as che desigu'd ae-
wmplisher o( God's economy towards mun. ”ris iu short, the
nudent Ebionite or Νυκτεῖ] systum, as to the making οἱ J esus a
mei-e man, thu' not with them the Suu of Juseph, but divinvly
conoeiv'd by the Virgin Max-y, and agrees in every thing almost
with the scheme of our moriem Unitarims 3 exoeptiug the history
01 hi! death :nd resurreetion, about which ι very different ncwunt
is given from that in our Gospels z but perfectly conform-hle ω
the tradition of the Mnhumetaus, who maiutain chat another was
